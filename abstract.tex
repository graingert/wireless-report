The project sets out to determine if those who distribute malicious content
use trending topics on services such as Twitter or the News Media so as to
gain some of the traffic from users searching for legitimate information about
those topics.

The project discusses design and implementation of a distributed framework
designed to organise multiple subsystems that process trending topics from
these sources and emulate a user browsing for pages related to those trending
topics. In the process those pages accessed are evaluated for malicious
content hoping to distribute malware to unsuspecting users using drive by
download toolkits.
