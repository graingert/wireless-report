\subsection{Evaluation of ClamAV Malware Scan}
Anti-virus scanning gives the system the ability to detect malicious 
signature patterns in various file types that may exist in webpages. The 
testing results proved the fast response and scanning speed of ClamAV. The 
program returns an list of malware found in a particular website and 
is self-contained.

A limitation 
of this project is the exclusion of links to other domains. It might be too 
decisive which is highly possible to miss malicious files, as it is 
not rare to see a webpage contain a direct download link which points to a 
virus executable hosted on another website that cannot be easily found by 
a search engine. Apart from other disadvantages inherited from a low interaction 
detection method, the system does not filter obvious 
harmless file types, such as images and videos. It could have been a more polished system if 
the project schedule was more flexible.
